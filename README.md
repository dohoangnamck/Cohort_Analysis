Cohort Analysis by Retention

Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics in which you take a group of users, and analyze their usage patterns based on their shared traits to better track and understand their actions. A cohort is simply a group of people with shared characteristics.

Cohort analysis allows you to ask more specific, targeted questions and make informed product decisions that will reduce churn and drastically increase revenue. You could also call it customer churn analysis.
